# Party Planner demo for UChicago Web Services

`party-planner` demonstrates how to create and deploy a simple Rails application. It was created for the benefit of the staff of the Web Services department, IT Services, [The University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/).

The project is demo-only, and not intended for general use. The data model is ludicrous (logically, a guest would want to sign up for more than one party, to cite the most blatant problem), it’s insecure, I know all the defects. It’s what I can get into 20 minutes and 25 slides.
